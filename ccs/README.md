## Authenticating to Ccs

Ccs uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto Ccs
* click Settings -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again). When running a Ccs compatible script for the first time, you will be prompted for a password. Enter the API key as the password.
