## Components

* [ccsSlaMonitor.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohesity/community-automation-samples/main/ccs/powershell/ccsSlaMonitor/ccsSlaMonitor.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohesity/community-automation-samples/main/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```powershell
./ccsSlaMonitor.ps1
```

## Parameters

* -username: (optional) used for API key storage only (default is 'ccs')
* -password: (optional) API key
* -noPrompt: (optional) do not prompt for API key
* -days: (optional) number of days back to search (default is 2)
* -pageSize: (optional) API query page size (default is 500)

## Authenticating to Ccs

Ccs uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto Ccs
* click Settings -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again). When running a Ccs compatible script for the first time, you will be prompted for a password. Enter the API key as the password.
