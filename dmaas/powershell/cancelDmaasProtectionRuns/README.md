Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```powershell
./cancelDmaasProtectionRuns.ps1 -region us-east-2
```

## Parameters

* -username: (optional) used for password storage only (default is 'DMaaS')
* -region: DMaaS region to use (e.g. us-east-2)
* -environment: (optional) e.g. kO365
* -subType: (optional) e.g. kO365Sharepoint

## Authenticating to DMaaS

DMaaS uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto DMaaS
* click Settings -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again). When running a DMaaS compatible script for the first time, you will be prompted for a password. Enter the API key as the password.
