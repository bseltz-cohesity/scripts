This PowerShell script generates a report of included and excluded file paths per host. The script will generate an html report and also generate a CSV file.

## Download the script

Run these commands from PowerShell to download the script(s) into your current directory

```powershell
# Download Commands
$scriptName = 'protectedDmaasFilePathReport'
$repoURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master'
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/dmaas/powershell/$scriptName/$scriptName.ps1").content | Out-File "$scriptName.ps1"; (Get-Content "$scriptName.ps1") | Set-Content "$scriptName.ps1"

# End Download Commands
```

## Components

* [protectedDmaasFilePathReport.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohesity/community-automation-samples/main/dmaas/powershell/protectedDmaasFilePathReport/protectedDmaasFilePathReport.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohesity/community-automation-samples/main/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```powershell
./protectedDmaasFilePathReport.ps1
```

## Parameters

* -username: (optional) used for password storage only (default is 'DMaaS')
* -password: (optional) API key for authentication (will be prompted and stored if omitted)
* -noPrompt: (optional) do not prompt for API key

## Authenticating to Helios

Helios uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto Helios
* click Settings -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again). When running a Helios compatible script for the first time, you will be prompted for a password. Enter the API key as the password.
