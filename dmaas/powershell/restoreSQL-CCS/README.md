```powershell
# Download Commands
$scriptName = 'restoreSQL-CCS'
$repoURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master'
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/dmaas/powershell/$scriptName/$scriptName.ps1").content | Out-File "$scriptName.ps1"; (Get-Content "$scriptName.ps1") | Set-Content "$scriptName.ps1"

## Components

* [restoreSQL-CCS.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/dmaas/powershell/restoreSQL-CCS/restoreSQL-CCS.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

To restore all databases (except system databases) to the original location:

```powershell
./restoreSQL-CCS.ps1 -username myusername@mydomain.net `
                     -region us-west-2 `
                     -sourceServer sqlserver1.mydomain.net `
                     -allDBs `
                     -overWrite `
                     -commit
```

To restore all databases (except system databases) to an alternate server:

```powershell
./restoreSQL-CCS.ps1 -username myusername@mydomain.net `
                     -region us-west-2 `
                     -sourceServer sqlserver1.mydomain.net `
                     -allDBs `
                     -targetServer sqlserver2.mydomain.net `
                     -commit
```

## Authentication Parameters

* -username: (optional) name of user to connect to CCS (defaults to helios)
* -password: (optional) will use cached password or will be prompted
* -noPrompt: (optional) do not prompt for password
* -region: CCS region to connect to

## Source Parameters

* -sourceServer: Server name (or AAG name) where the database was backed up
* -sourceInstance: (optional) Name of source SQL instance to restore from
* -sourceNodes: (optional) Filter on databases from specific AAG nodes (comma separated)
* -sourceDB: (optional) One or more databases to restore (e.g. MyDB or MYINSTANCE/MyDB) (comma separated)
* -sourceDBList: (optional) Text file of databases to restore (e.g. MyDB or MYINSTANCE/MyDB) (one per line)
* -allDBs: (optional) restore all databases from specified server/instance
* -newerThan: (optional) when restoring allDBs, only include databases backed up in the last X days
* -includeSystemDBs: (optional) also restore system DBs (master, model, msdb)

## Target Parameters

* -targetServer: (optional) Server name to restore to (defaults to same as sourceServer)
* -targetInstance: (optional) SQL instance to restore to (defaults to MSSQLSERVER)

## Rename Parameters

* -targetDB: (optional) name of new database (only allowed when restoring one database)
* -prefix: (optional) Prefix to apply to database names (e.g. 'Dev')
* -suffix: (optional) Suffix to apply to database names (e.g. 'Dev')

## File Path Parameters

* -showPaths: (optional) show file paths for selected databases and exit without restore
* -exportPaths: (optional) export DB file path info and exit (file name is sourceserver.json)
* -importPaths: (optional) import DB file path info (use in conjunction with -useSourcePaths)
* -mdfFolder: (optional) Location to place the primary data file (e.g. C:\SQLData)
* -ldfFolder: (optional) Location to place the log files (defaults to same as mdfFolder)
* -ndfFolders: (optional) Locations to place various ndf files (see below)

## Point in Time Parameters

* -logTime: Point in time to replay the logs to during the restore (e.g. '2019-04-10 22:31:05')
* -noStop: Replay the logs to the last transaction available

## Recovery Option Parameters

* -noRecovery: (optional) Restore the DB with NORECOVER option (default is to recover)
* -keepCdc: (optional) Keep CDC
* -captureTailLogs: (optional) Capture tail logs
* -overwrite: (optional) Overwrites an existing database (default is no overwrite)

## Misc Parameters

* -commit: (optional) perform the restores (otherwise just show what would be done)
* -wait: (optional) wait for the restore to complete and report end status (e.g. Succeeded)
* -progress: (optional) report percent complete per database during the restore

## Always On Availability Groups

Use the **AAG name** as the **-sourceServer** when restoring from an AAG backup (e.g. -sourceServer myAAG1)

## Overwrite Warning

Including the **-overwrite** parameter will overwrite an existing database. Use this parameter with extreme caution.

## Multiple Folders for Secondary NDF Files

```powershell
-ndfFolders @{'*1.ndf'='E:\sqlrestore\ndf1'; '*2.ndf'='E:\sqlrestore\ndf2'}
```

## Point in Time Recovery

By default, the last available log backup point in time is selected. For databases with no log backups, the last full/incremental backup is selected.

If you want to replay logs to a specific point in time, use the **-logTime** parameter and specify a date and time in military format like so:

```powershell
-logTime '2019-01-20 23:47:02'
```

For databases with no log backups, the full/incremental backup that occured at or before -logTime will be selected.

If you want to ensure that you restore the very latest logs (to the millisecond) then use the **-noStop** parameter.

## Authenticating to DMaaS

DMaaS uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto DMaaS
* click Settings -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again). When running a DMaaS compatible script for the first time, you will be prompted for a password. Enter the API key as the password.
