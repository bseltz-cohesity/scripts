This python script downloads a CCS Agent.

## Download the script

You can download the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
# download commands
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/downloadCCSAgent/downloadCCSAgent.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity.py
chmod +x downloadCCSAgent.py
# end download commands
```

## Components

* downloadCCSAgent.py: the main powershell script
* pyhesity.py: the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```bash
./downloadCCSAgent.py -p Windows
```

```bash
./downloadCCSAgent.py -p Linux -t RPM
```

## Parameters

* -u, --username: (optional) username to authenticate to DMaaS (used for password storage only)
* -pwd, --password: (optional) password or API key
* -np, --noprompt: (optional) do not prompt for password
* -p, --platform: (optional) 'Windows' or 'Linux' (default is 'Windows')
* -t, --packageType: (optional) for Linux agent, 'RPM', 'DEB', 'Script' or 'SuseRPM' (default is 'RPM')

## Authenticating to DMaaS

DMaaS uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto DMaaS
* click Settings -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again). When running a DMaaS compatible script for the first time, you will be prompted for a password. Enter the API key as the password.
