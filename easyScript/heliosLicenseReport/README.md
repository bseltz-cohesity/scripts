## Getting an API Key for Helios

Helios uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto Helios
* click the gear icon -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again).

## Uploading to EasyScript

* In EasyScript, click "Upload a Script"
* Enter a descriptive name for the script
* Select Python 2.7 or 3.7 (both work for this script)
* enter a description (optional)
* enter the arguments
* browse and upload the zip file

## Arguments

* -k, --apikey

* -p, --mailport: (optional) defaults to 25
* -f, --sendfrom: email address to show in the from field
* -t, --sendto: email addresses to send report to (use repeatedly to add recipients)

For example: you can have the script send a report via email using the folllowing arguments:

```bash

```
