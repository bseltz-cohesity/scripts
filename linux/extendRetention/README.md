# Extend Retention for Linux

Warning: this code is provided on a best effort basis and is not in any way officially supported or sanctioned by Cohesity. The code is intentionally kept simple to retain value as example code. The code in this repository is provided as-is and the author accepts no liability for damages resulting from its use.

This is a compiled binary that extends the retention of existing snapshots. It can set new expiration dates for weekly, monthly and yearly snapshots.

## Download The Binary

<https://github.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/raw/master/linux/extendRetention/extendRetention>

Run the tool like so:

```bash
# example
./extendRetention -s mycluster -u myusername -d mydomain.net -j "SQL*" -j "*ackup" -wr 35 -w 6 -mr 365 -m 1 -ms mail.mydomain.net -mp 25 -to myuser@mydomain.com -fr someuser@mydomain.com
# end example
```

The script output should be similar to the following:
