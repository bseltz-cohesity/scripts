## Components

* cloneOracleBackupToView.ps1: the main powershell script
* cohesity-api.ps1: the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together, then we can run the script.

To clone all available backups:

```powershell
./cloneOracleBackupToView.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                        -username myuser `
                        -domain mydomain.net `
                        -jobName 'My Oracle Job' `
                        -objectName myoracleserver.mydomain.net `
                        -viewName cloned
```

To limit access to specific users:

```powershell
./cloneOracleBackupToView.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                        -username myuser `
                        -domain mydomain.net `
                        -jobName 'My Oracle Job' `
                        -objectName myoracleserver.mydomain.net `
                        -viewName cloned `
                        -access 'mydomain.net\domain admins', mydomain.net\othergroup
```

To delete a view when finished:

```powershell
./cloneOracleBackupToView.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                        -username myuser `
                        -domain mydomain.net `
                        -viewName cloned `
                        -deleteView
```
