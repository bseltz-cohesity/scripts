## Components

* [registerOracle.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/oracle/powershell/registerOracle/registerOracle.ps1): the main PowerShell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module
* servers.txt: an optional text file containing a list of serversto add to the protection job

Place all files in a folder together. Optionally create a text file called servers.txt and populate with the servers that you want to protect, like so:

```text
server1.mydomain.net
server2.mydomain.net
server3.mydomain.net
```

Note that the servers in the text file must be registered in Cohesity, and should match the name format as shown in the Cohesity UI.

Then, run the main script like so:

```powershell
./registerOracle.ps1 -vip mycluster -username myusername -server myerver
```

or

```powershell
./registerOracle.ps1 -vip mycluster -username myusername -serverList ./servers.txt
```

```text
Connected!

```
