This script clones Oracle backups to a user-accessible Cohesity View

## Components

* [cloneOracleBackupsToView.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/oracle/python/cloneOracleBackupsToView/cloneOracleBackupsToView.py): the main python script
* [pyhesity.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity/pyhesity.py): the Cohesity REST API helper module

You can download the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
# download commands
