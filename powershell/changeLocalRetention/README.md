# Change Retention of Local Snapshots using PowerShell

Warning: this code is provided on a best effort basis and is not in any way officially supported or sanctioned by Cohesity. The code is intentionally kept simple to retain value as example code. The code in this repository is provided as-is and the author accepts no liability for damages resulting from its use.

This powershell script will change (increase or decrease) the retention of existing snapshots. Note that if you reduce the retention, older backups might immediately get expired!

## Warning! This script deletes backup data! Make sure you know what you are doing before you run it

## Download the Scripts

Run these commands from PowerShell to download the scripts into the current folder:

```powershell
# Download Commands
$scriptName = 'changeLocalRetention'
$repoURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell'
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/$scriptName/$scriptName.ps1").content | Out-File "$scriptName.ps1"; (Get-Content "$scriptName.ps1") | Set-Content "$scriptName.ps1"
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1").content | Out-File cohesity-api.ps1; (Get-Content cohesity-api.ps1) | Set-Content cohesity-api.ps1
# End Download Commands
```

## Components

* [changeLocalRetention.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/changeLocalRetention/changeLocalRetention.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together, then we can run the script.

First, run the script WITHOUT the -commit switch to see what would be deleted.

```powershell
./changeLocalRetention.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                           -username myuser `
                           -domain mydomain.net `
                           -jobName 'My Job' `
                           -daysToKeep 10
```

To limit the protection groups to those whose names match the string 'VMs':

```powershell
./changeLocalRetention.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                           -username myuser `
                           -domain mydomain.net `
                           -jobMatch 'vms' `
                           -daysToKeep 10
```

If you're happy with the list of snapshots that will be changed, run the script again and include the -force switch.

Warning: Any snapshots whose new expire date is set to a date in the past will expire immediately!
