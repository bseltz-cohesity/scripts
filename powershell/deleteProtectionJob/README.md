## Components

* [deleteProtectionJob.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/deleteProtectionJob/deleteProtectionJob.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```powershell
./deleteProtectionJob.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                          -username myusername `
                          -domain mydomain.net `
                          -jobName myjob
```

To also delete the existing snapshots:

```powershell
./deleteProtectionJob.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                          -username myusername `
                          -domain mydomain.net `
                          -jobName myjob `
                          -deleteSnapshots
```

To delete the existing snapshhots for a job that has already been deleted:

```powershell
./deleteProtectionJob.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                          -username myusername `
                          -domain mydomain.net `
                          -jobName _DELETED_myjob `
                          -deleteSnapshots
```

To specify more than one job to process, you can provide multiple job names on the command line:

```powershell
./deleteProtectionJob.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                          -username myusername `
                          -domain mydomain.net `
                          -jobName myjob1, myjob2 `
                          -deleteSnapshots
```

Or provide a text file of job names (one per line):

```powershell
./deleteProtectionJob.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                          -username myusername `
                          -domain mydomain.net `
                          -jobList .\myjobs.txt `
                          -deleteSnapshots
```
