This powershell script downloads the warning messages (if any) from each object of the last run of a protection group. Downloaded files will be named groupname-objectname-warnings.txt.

## Download the Scripts

Run these commands from PowerShell to download the scripts into the current folder:

```powershell
# Download Commands
$scriptName = 'downloadLatestWarnings'
$repoURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohesity/community-automation-samples/main/powershell'
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/$scriptName/$scriptName.ps1").content | Out-File "$scriptName.ps1"; (Get-Content "$scriptName.ps1") | Set-Content "$scriptName.ps1"
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1").content | Out-File cohesity-api.ps1; (Get-Content cohesity-api.ps1) | Set-Content cohesity-api.ps1
# End Download Commands
```

## Components

* [downloadLatestWarnings.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohesity/community-automation-samples/main/powershell/downloadLatestWarnings/downloadLatestWarnings.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohesity/community-automation-samples/main/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module
