# Expunge Data Spillage with PowerShell

Warning: this code is provided on a best effort basis and is not in any way officially supported or sanctioned by Cohesity. The code is intentionally kept simple to retain value as example code. The code in this repository is provided as-is and the author accepts no liability for damages resulting from its use.

## Warning! This script deletes backup data! Make sure you know what you are doing before you run it

This powershell script searches for a file, and displays the ProtectionJobs/Objects where the file is stored. You can then select a ProtectionJob/Object and the script will delete all versions of the ProtectionJob/Object where that file exists. The deletion will include the local snapshots plus any archives. Replicas can deleted by running the script against the replica cluster.

If you run the script without the -delete switch, the script will only display what it would delete. Use the -delete switch to actually perform the deletions.

Deletions will be logged to scriptPath/expungeLog.txt

## Components

* expungeDataSpillage.ps1: the main powershell script
* cohesity-api.ps1: Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together, then we can run the script.

```powershell
### usage: ./expungeDataSpillage.ps1 -vip mycluster -username admin [ -domain local ] -search 'partial/filepath' [ -delete ]
```

First, run the script WITHOUT the -delete switch to see what would be deleted.

```powershell
powershell> ./expungeDataSpillage.ps1 -vip mycluster -username admin [ -domain mydomain ] -search 'secretfile'

Then, if you're happy with what would be deleted, re-run the script again and include the -delete switch. THIS WILL DELETE BACKUP DATA!!!

Please note that there may be some delay before the deletions are reflected in file search results.
