Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```powershell
./fixRedundantProtection.ps1 -vip myCluster -username myUser -jobName 'My Job' -fix

Connected!
Found The following objects also protected in job: Redundant:
  CentOS1
  CentOS2
  fixing...
```

## Parameters

* -vip: Cohesity Cluster to connect to
