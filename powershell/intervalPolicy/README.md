```powershell
# Download Commands
$scriptName = 'intervalPolicy'
$repoURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell'
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/$scriptName/intervalPolicy.ps1").content | Out-File "intervalPolicy.ps1"; (Get-Content "intervalPolicy.ps1") | Set-Content "intervalPolicy.ps1"

# End Download Commands
```

## Components

* [intervalPolicy.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/intervalPolicy/intervalPolicy.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

## Example

Place the files in a folder together and run the script like so:

```powershell
./intervalPolicy.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                     -username myuser `
                     -domain mydomain.net `
                     -policyName 'my policy' `
                     -intervalMinutes 20
