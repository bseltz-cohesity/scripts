```

## Components

* [jobAlertRecipients.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/jobAlertRecipients/jobAlertRecipients.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place the files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```powershell
# Command line example
./jobAlertRecipients.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                           -username myuser `
                           -domain mydomain.net `
                           -addAddress myuser1@mydomain.net, myuser2@mydomain.net `
                           -removeAddress myuser3@mydomain.net, myuser4@mydomain.net
# End example
```

If you want to just list the existing alert recipients, omit the -addAddress and -removeAddress

If you want to focus on a specific job type (SQL for example) use -jobType SQL

If you want to focus on specific jobs, you can use -jobName 'job 1', 'job 2' or you can have a text file of job names (one job name per line) and use -jobList ./myjoblist.txt
