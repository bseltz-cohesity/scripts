## Authentication Parameters

* -vip: (optional) name or IP of Cohesity cluster (defaults to helios.cohesity.com)
* -username: (optional) name of user to connect to Cohesity (defaults to helios)
* -domain: (optional) your AD domain (defaults to local)

## Other Parameters

* -oldViewName: the name of the view to copy quotas from
* -newViewName: the name of the view to copy quotas to

## Authenticating to Helios

The Test/Wrapper scripts can be configured to log onto clusters directly, or log onto Helios.

Helios uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto Helios
* click the gear icon -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again). When running a Helios compatible script for the first time, you will be prompted for a password. Enter the API key as the password.
