# Move Protection Group to new Storage Domain Using PowerShell

Warning: this code is provided on a best effort basis and is not in any way officially supported or sanctioned by Cohesity. The code is intentionally kept simple to retain value as example code. The code in this repository is provided as-is and the author accepts no liability for damages resulting from its use.

This PowerShell script migrates a protection group from one storage domain to another.

**Note:** that existing snapshots can not be migrated. They can either be left to expire as scheduled or deleted (manually, later, in the UI). If left to expire, please note that the new job will consume additional storage in the new storage domain, thus increasing the overall cluster storage consumption until the old snapshots expire.

## Components

* [moveProtectionGroup.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/moveProtectionGroup/moveProtectionGroup.ps1): the main PowerShell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

                          -domain mydomain.net `
                          -jobName 'My Job' `
                          -newStorageDomainName otherStorageDomain
```

## Authentication Parameters

* -vip: (optional) name or IP of Cohesity cluster (defaults to helios.cohesity.com)
* -username: (optional) name of user to connect to Cohesity (defaults to helios)
* -domain: (optional) your AD domain (defaults to local)
* -useApiKey: (optional) use API key for authentication
* -password: (optional) will use cached password or will be prompted
* -noPrompt: (optional) do not prompt for password
* -tenant: (optional) organization to impersonate
* -mcm: (optional) connect through MCM
* -mfaCode: (optional) TOTP MFA code
* -clusterName: (optional) cluster to connect to when connecting through Helios or MCM

## Other Parameters

* -jobName: (optional) one or more protection group names to migrate (comma separated)
* -jobList: (optional) text file of protection group names to migrate (one per line)
* -newStorageDomainName: name of storage domain to migrate to
* -newPolicyName: (optional) change the policy used by the job
* -prefix: (optional) add a prefix to the name of the new protection group
* -suffix: (optional) add a suffix to the name of the new protection group
* -renameOldJob: (optional) apply prefix and suffix to old protection group (instead of the new protection group)
* -deleteOldJob: (optional) delete the old protection group
* -pauseOldJob: (optional) pause the old job
* -pauseNewJob: (optional) pause the new job

## Notes

You must use either -prefix, -suffix or -deleteOldJob to avoid conflicting job names.

In some cases it's not possible to protect the same object in two jobs (e.g. SQL servers), so it's nessesary to use -deleteOldJob in those cases.
