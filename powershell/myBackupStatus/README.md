This PowerShell script detects if the specified object is currently being backed up.

## Download the script

Run these commands from PowerShell to download the script(s) into your current directory

```powershell
# Download Commands
$scriptName = 'myBackupStatus'
$repoURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell'
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/$scriptName/$scriptName.ps1").content | Out-File "$scriptName.ps1"; (Get-Content "$scriptName.ps1") | Set-Content "$scriptName.ps1"
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1").content | Out-File cohesity-api.ps1; (Get-Content cohesity-api.ps1) | Set-Content cohesity-api.ps1
# End Download Commands
```

## Components

* [myBackupStatus.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/myBackupStatus/myBackupStatus.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together, then we can run the script.

```powershell
# example
./myBackupStatus.py -vip mycluster `
                    -username myuser `
                    -domain mydomain.net ` 
                    -myName vm1 `
                    -wait
# end example
```

If the script detects a current backup run for vm1:

* if the -wait switch was used, the script will monitor the backup to completion and then exit with exit code 0
* -f the -wait switch was not used, the script will exit with exit code1 (backup running)

If the script does not detect a running backup, it will exit with exit code 0
