## Download the script

Run these commands from PowerShell to download the script(s) into your current directory

```powershell
# Download Commands
$scriptName = 'replicateNow'
$repoURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell'
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/$scriptName/$scriptName.ps1").content | Out-File "$scriptName.ps1"; (Get-Content "$scriptName.ps1") | Set-Content "$scriptName.ps1"
(Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "$repoUrl/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1").content | Out-File cohesity-api.ps1; (Get-Content cohesity-api.ps1) | Set-Content cohesity-api.ps1
# End Download Commands
```

## Components

* [replicateNow.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/replicateNow/replicateNow.ps1): the main powershell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module [README](https://github.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/tree/master/powershell/cohesity-api)

Place both files in a folder together, then we can run the script like so:

```powershell
./replicateNow.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                   -username myuser `
                   -domain mydomain.net `

                   -remoteCluster othercluster `
                   -keepFor 31 `
                   -commit
```
