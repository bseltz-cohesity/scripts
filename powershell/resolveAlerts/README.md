To list unresolved alerts

                    -username myusername `
                    -domain mydomain.net

To filter on a specific severity:

```powershell
./resolveAlerts.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                    -username myusername `
                    -domain mydomain.net `
                    -severity kCritical
```

To filter on a specific alertType:

```powershell
