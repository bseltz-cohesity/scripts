* -recoveryArgs: arguments for recovery, e.g. '--target-dir=/var/lib/pgsql/10/data/'

## Additional Parameters

* -objectName: (optional) database names to restore (comma separated)
* -prefix: (optional) prefix to apply to database names
* -targetServer: (optional) Server name to restore to (defaults to same as sourceServer)
* -logTime: (optional) Point in time to replay the logs to during the restore (e.g. '2019-04-10 22:31:05')
* -latest: (optional) Replay the logs to the latest log backup date
* -wait: (optional) Wait for the restore to complete and report end status (e.g. kSuccess)

* -progress: (optional) display percent complete
* -concurrency: (optional) number of concurrency streams (default is 1)
* -mounts: (optional) number of mounts (default is 1)

## Point in Time Recovery

By default (if both **-latest** and **-logTime** are omitted), the latest full/incremental snapshot time will be used for the restore.

If you want to replay the logs to the very latest available point in time, use the **-latest** parameter, or if you want to replay logs to a specific point in time, use the **-logTime** parameter and specify a date and time in military format like so:

```powershell
-logTime '2019-01-20 23:47:02'
```

Note that when the -logTime parameter is used with databases where no log backups exist, the full/incremental backup that occurred at or before the specified log time will be used. Also note that if a logtime is specified that is newer than the latest log backup, the latest log backup time will be used.
