## Download the script

Run these commands from PowerShell to download the script(s) into your current directory

```powershell
# Download Commands
$scriptName = 'storePasswordAsUser'
$repoURL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell'

# End Download Commands
```

## Components

* [storePasswordAsUser.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/storePasswordAsUser/storePasswordAsUser.ps1): the main PowerShell script
* [cohesity-api.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/powershell/cohesity-api/cohesity-api.ps1): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```powershell
./storePasswordAsUser.ps1 -vip mycluster -username myusername -domain mydomain.net
```

## Parameters

* -vip: the Cohesity cluster to connect to
* -username: the cohesity user to login with
* -domain: (optional) domain of the Cohesity user (defaults to local)

## Notes

When you run the script, you will be prompted to enter credentials for another Windows user. A new PowerShell session will start as that user, and then you will be prompted to enter the password for the specified vip/username/domain. If the response is 'Connected!' then the password has been stored successfully.
