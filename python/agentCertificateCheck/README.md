# Report Agent Certificates using Python

Warning: this code is provided on a best effort basis and is not in any way officially supported or sanctioned by Cohesity. The code is intentionally kept simple to retain value as example code. The code in this repository is provided as-is and the author accepts no liability for damages resulting from its use.

This script will report certificate expirations for registered agents.

Note: this script will only run on Linux where the openssl command is available. You can run it directly on the Cohesity cluster if shell access is available, or on a linux host. The script requires direct network access to the hosts via port 50051/tcp, so inter-site firewall rules would be problematic.

## Components

* agentCertificateCheck.py: the main python script
* pyhesity.py: the Cohesity REST API helper module

You can download the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
# download commands
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/agentCertificateCheck/agentCertificateCheck.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity.py
chmod +x agentCertificateCheck.py
# end download commands
```

Running the script against one cluster (with direct authentication):

```bash
./agentCertificateCheck.py -v mycluster -u myuser -d local  # -d myAdDomain.net (for active directory)
```
  * If running the script directly from the cluster (with direct authentication):
    ```bash
    python3 agentCertificateCheck.py -v mycluster -u myuser -d local  # -d myAdDomain.net (for active directory)
    ```
      * -Depending on the python version on the Cohesity Cluster node, this command may be:
        ```bash
        python agentCertificateCheck.py -v mycluster -u myuser -d local  # -d myAdDomain.net (for active directory)
        ```

Running the script against all Helios clusters (note: you will need to create an API key in helios and use that as the password when prompted):

```bash
./agentCertificateCheck.py -u myuser@mydomain.net
```
  * If running the script directly from the cluster against all Helios clusters (note: you will need to create an API key in helios and use that as the password when prompted):
    ```bash
    python3 agentCertificateCheck.py -u myuser@mydomain.net
    ```
      * -Depending on the python version on the Cohesity Cluster node, this command may be:
        ```bash
        python agentCertificateCheck.py -u myuser@mydomain.net
        ```

Running the script against selected Helios clusters (note: you will need to create an API key in helios and use that as the password when prompted):

```bash
./agentCertificateCheck.py -u myuser@mydomain.net -c cluster1 -c cluster2
```
  * If running the script directly from the cluster against selected Helios clusters (note: you will need to create an API key in helios and use that as the password when prompted):
    ```bash
    python3 agentCertificateCheck.py -u myuser@mydomain.net -c cluster1 -c cluster2
    ```
      * -Depending on the python version on the Cohesity Cluster node, this command may be:
        ```bash
        python agentCertificateCheck.py -u myuser@mydomain.net -c cluster1 -c cluster2
        ```

## Authentication Parameters

* -v, --vip: (optional) DNS or IP of the Cohesity cluster to connect to (default is helios.cohesity.com)
* -u, --username: (optional) username to authenticate to Cohesity cluster (default is helios)
* -d, --domain: (optional) domain of username (defaults to local)
* -i, --useApiKey: (optional) use API key for authentication
* -pwd, --password: (optional) password or API key
* -np, --noprompt: (optional) do not prompt for password
* -mcm, --mcm: (optional) connect through MCM
* -c, --clustername: (optional) helios/mcm cluster to connect to (will loop through all clusters if connected to helios)
* -m, --mfacode: (optional) MFA code for authentication
* -e, --emailmfacode: (optional) send MFA code via email

## Other Parameters

* -x, --expirywarningdate: (optional) default is '2023-06-01 00:00:00'

## The Python Helper Module - pyhesity.py

The helper module provides functions to simplify operations such as authentication, api calls, storing encrypted passwords, and converting date formats. The module requires the requests python module.

### Installing the Prerequisites

```bash
sudo yum install python-requests
```

or

```bash
sudo easy_install requests
```
