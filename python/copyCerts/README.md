# Copy CA Certificates from One Cluster to Another Using Python

Warning: this code is provided on a best effort basis and is not in any way officially supported or sanctioned by Cohesity. The code is intentionally kept simple to retain value as example code.

This script copies the CA certificate chain and private key from one cluster to another, so that multi-cluster agent registration is possible.

## Download the script

You can download the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
# download commands
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/copyCerts/copyCerts.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity.py
chmod +x copyCerts.py
# end download commands
```

## Components

* [copyCerts.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/copyCerts/copyCerts.py): the main python script
* [pyhesity.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity/pyhesity.py): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

To copy certs from one cluster to another:

```bash
# example
./copyCerts.py -sc mycluster1 \
               -su myuser1 \
               -tc mycluster2 \
               -tu myuser2
# end example
```

To restore a cluster's original certs:

```bash
# example
./copyCerts.py -tc mycluster2 \
               -tu myuser2 \
               -r
# end example
```
