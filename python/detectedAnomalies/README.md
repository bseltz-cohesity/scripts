This script reports Helios Detected Ransomeware Anomalies and forwards them to syslog.

## Download the script

You can download the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
# download commands
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/detectedAnomalies/detectedAnomalies.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity.py
chmod +x detectedAnomalies.py
# end download commands
```

## Components

* [detectedAnomalies.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/detectedAnomalies/detectedAnomalies.py): the main python script
* [pyhesity.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity/pyhesity.py): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```bash
./detectedAnomalies.py -u myusername
```

## Note

When prompted for your password, enter the API Key for your Helios account (see Authentication section below).

## Parameters

* -v, --vip: (optional) mcm or helios (defaults to helios.cohesity.com)
* -u, --username: (optional) username to authenticate (defaults to helios)
* -d, --domain: (optional) defaults to local
* -pwd, --password: (optional) will use cached password if omitted
* -m, --minimumstrength: (optional) defaults to 10
* -y, --days: (optional) number of days to look back (default is 7)

## Authenticating to Helios

Helios uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto Helios
* click the gear icon -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again). When running a Helios compatible script for the first time, you will be prompted for a password. Enter the API key as the password.

If you enter the wrong password, you can re-enter the password like so:

```python
> from pyhesity import *
> apiauth(username='myusername', updatepw=True)
Enter your password: *********************
```
