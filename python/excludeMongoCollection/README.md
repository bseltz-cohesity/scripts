Warning: this code is provided on a best effort basis and is not in any way officially supported or sanctioned by Cohesity. The code is intentionally kept simple to retain value as example code.

This script excludes MongoDB collections from protection groups where auto-protect is used.

## Download the script

You can download the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
# download commands
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/excludeMongoCollection/excludeMongoCollection.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity.py
chmod +x excludeMongoCollection.py
# end download commands
```

## Components

* [excludeMongoCollection.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/excludeMongoCollection/excludeMongoCollection.py): the main python script
* [pyhesity.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity/pyhesity.py): the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```bash
./excludeMongoCollection.py -v mycluster \
                            -u myuser \
                            -d mydomain.net \
                            -n collection1 \
                            -n collection2
```

By default, the script will exclude the collection(s) from all MongoDB protection groups. Optionally you can narrow the scope to specific jobs using the --jobname and --jooblist parameters.
