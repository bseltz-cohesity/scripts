# Cohesity REST API Python Examples - Legacy Version

Warning: this code is provided on a best effort basis and is not in any way officially supported or sanctioned by Cohesity. The code is intentionally kept simple to retain value as example code.

## Cohesity REST API Helper Module: pyhesity.py

pyhesity.py contains a set of functions that make it easy to use the Cohesity REST API, including functions for authentication, making REST calls, and managing date formats.

### Download the Module

Use the following command to download the module:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity-legacy/pyhesity.py
```

### Installing the Prerequisites

pyhesity.py requires the requests python module. To install it, do one of the following:

```bash
sudo yum install python-requests
```

or

```bash
sudo easy_install requests
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from pyhesity import *
apiauth('mycluster', 'admin') # domain defaults to local
# or
apiauth('mycluster', 'myuser', 'mydomain.net') # specify an Active Directory domain
```

### Stored Passwords

Although there is a password parameter, it is not recommended to use it. Instead, the fist time you attempt to authenticate to a cluster, you will be prompted for your password. The password will be encrypted and stored in <user's home folder>/.pyhesity. The stored password will then be used automatically so that scripts can run unattended.

If your password changes, you will be prompted again to re-enter it.

To preemptively update the stored password, use apiauth with updatepw to prompt for the new password.

```python
from pyhesity import *
apiauth('mycluster', 'myuser', 'mydomain.net', updatepw=True)
```

If you don't want to store a password and want to be prompted to enter your password when you run your script, use prompt=True

```python
from pyhesity import *
apiauth('mycluster', 'myuser', 'mydomain', prompt=True)
```

### Using a Password File

If you want to use a shared, portable password file, you can use the setpwd function:

```python
from pyhesity import *
setpwd('mycluster','myuser','mydomain.net')
```

You will be prompted to enter the password, and the password will be stored, encrypted, in a file called YWRtaW4 in the current folder. This file will be queried for passwords when scripts are run. If the required password is not found in the file, you will be prompted as usual.

The password file can be copied to other hosts to make password management easier.

### API Calls

Once authenticated, you can make API calls. For example:

```python
print(api('get', 'protectionJobs')[0]['name'])
VM Backup
```

### Date Conversions

Cohesity stores dates in Unix Epoch Microseconds. That's the number of microseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970. Several conversion functions have been included to handle these dates.

```python
api('get','protectionJobs')[0]['creationTimeUsecs']
1533978038503713
  
usecsToDate(1533978038503713)
'2018-08-11 05:00:38'
  
dateToUsecs('2018-08-11 05:00:38')
1533978038000000
  
timeAgo('24','hours')
1534410755000000
```

### Helios Access

You can connect to Helios. When prompted for a password, enter the apiKey (create one in Helios under access management).

```python
apiauth()
```

and list helios connected clusters:

```text
heliosCluster()

ClusterID           SoftwareVersion                     ClusterName
---------           ---------------                     -----------
3245772218955543    6.4.1_release-20191219_aafe3274     BKDataRep01
5860211595354073    6.4.1_release-20191219_aafe3274     BKDRRep02
8535175768906402    6.4.1a_release-20200127_bd2f17b1    Cluster-01
```

then choose a cluster to operate on:

```text
heliosCluster('Cluster-01')

Using Cluster-01
```

or loop through all clusters:

```python
from pyhesity import *

apiauth()

for cluster in heliosClusters():
    heliosCluster(cluster)
    thiscluster = api('get', 'cluster')
    if thiscluster:
        print('%-17s Metadata %% Used = %0.1f' % (thiscluster['name'], thiscluster['usedMetadataSpacePct']))
    else:
        print('%-17s (trouble accessing cluster)' % cluster['name'])
```

```text
BKDataRep01       Metadata % Used = 11.6
BKDRRep02         Metadata % Used = 11.6
Cluster-01        Metadata % Used = 6.1
co1               Metadata % Used = 43.2
Cohesity-02       Metadata % Used = 6.1
cohesity-agabriel Metadata % Used = 12.7
cohesity-c02      Metadata % Used = 12.5
Cohesity-ENash    Metadata % Used = 21.5
cohesity01        Metadata % Used = 15.6
Cohesity03        Metadata % Used = 18.8
Cohesity1-MP      Metadata % Used = 4.6
Cohesity2-MP      Metadata % Used = 6.1
```
