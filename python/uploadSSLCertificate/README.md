This python script uploads and installs an SSL certificate and private key onto a Cohesity cluster.

## Components

* [uploadSSLCertificate.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/uploadSSLCertificate/uploadSSLCertificate.py): the main python script
* [pyhesity.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity/pyhesity.py): the Cohesity REST API helper module

You can download the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
# download commands
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/uploadSSLCertificate/uploadSSLCertificate.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity.py
chmod +x uploadSSLCertificate.py
# end download commands
```

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```bash
./uploadSSLCertificate.py -v mycluster \
                          -u myusername \
                          -d mydomain.net \
                          -c ./mycluster_cert.pem \
                          -k ./mycluster_key.pem
```

## Parameters

* -v, --vip: DNS or IP of the Cohesity cluster to connect to
* -u, --username: username to authenticate to Cohesity cluster
* -d, --domain: (optional) domain of username, defaults to local
* -c, --certfile: path to certificate file (in PEM format)
* -k, --keyfile: path to private key file (in PEM format)

## The Python Helper Module - pyhesity.py

The helper module provides functions to simplify operations such as authentication, api calls, storing encrypted passwords, and converting date formats. The module requires the requests python module.

### Installing the Prerequisites

```bash
sudo yum install python-requests
```

or

```bash
sudo easy_install requests
```
