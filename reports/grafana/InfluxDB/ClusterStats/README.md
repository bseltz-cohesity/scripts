## Create a InfluxDB Data Source in Grafana

Configure the data source to point to your InfluxDB instance, for example:

* URL: <http://localhost:9090>
* Organization: MyCompany
* Token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
* Default Bucket: cohesity

## Setup an InfluxDB Exporter to Capture Cohesity Cluster Stats

Here is an example InfluxDB exporter that gets some time series stats from Cohesity

* [influxdbClusterStatsExporter.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/reports/grafana/InfluxDB/ClusterStats/influxdbClusterStatsExporter.py)
* [pyhesity.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity.py)

You will also need to install the python module influxdb_client

```bash
pip3 install influxdb_client
```

You can setup the exporter to run as a service:

example: /lib/systemd/system/cohesity-influxdb-exporter.service

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Cohesity InfluxDB Exporter Service

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin
ExecStart=/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/influx-start.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

example: /usr/local/bin/influx-start.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/usr/local/bin/scripts/python/influxClusterStatsExporter.py -v mycluster -u myuser 
```

## Import the Dashboard

In Grafana, go to Dashboards -> Import and upload the JSON file. Give the new dashboard a unique name and UID, and select our data source.
