## Components

* grootSoxReport.py: the main python script
* pyhesity.py: the Cohesity REST API helper module

You can download the scripts using the following commands:

```bash
# download commands
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/reports/groot/python/grootSoxReport/grootSoxReport.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity.py
chmod +x grootSoxReport.py
# end download commands
```

## Prerequisites

This python script requires two python modules (requests, psycopg2-binary) that are not present in the standard library. These can be installed in one of the following ways:

Using yum:

```bash
yum install python-requests python-psycopg2
```

Using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

Using easy_install:

```bash
easy_install requests
easy_install psycopg2-binary
```

## Running the script

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

```bash
# example
./grootSoxReport.py -v mycluster -u myuser -d mydomain.net
# end example

```bash
