## Authenticating to Helios

Helios uses an API key for authentication. To acquire an API key:

* log onto Helios
* click the gear icon -> access management -> API Keys
* click Add API Key
* enter a name for your key
* click Save

Immediately copy the API key (you only have one chance to copy the key. Once you leave the screen, you can not access it again). When running a Helios compatible script for the first time, you will be prompted for a password. Enter the API key as the password.

If you enter the wrong password, you can re-enter the password like so:

```powershell
> . .\cohesity-api.ps1
> apiauth -helios -updatePassword
Enter your password: *********************
```
