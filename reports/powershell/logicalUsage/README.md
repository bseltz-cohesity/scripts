          kView           2  Matt1

    Total Logical Size: 2,704 GB
```

By default, the script will search back 90 days to find the peak size of any object still in retention. If you have retention greater than 90 days, you can include the -days parameter, like:

```powershell
./logicalUsage.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                    -username myusername `
                    -domain mydomain.net `
                    -days 120
```

## Parameters

* -vip: Cohesity cluster to connect to
* -username: Cohesity username (e.g. admin)
* -domain: (optional) Active Directory domain (defaults to 'local')
* -days: (optional) number of days to look back (default is 90 days)
* -localOnly: (optional) default is to include replicated data
* -unit: (optional) KiB, MiB, GiB or TiB (default is MiB)
