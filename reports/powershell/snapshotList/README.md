You can include the -sorted parameter to get a list of snapshots sorted by date:

```powershell
./snapshotList.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                    -username myusername `
                    -domain mydomain.net `
                    -sorted
```

If you want to limit the scope to snapshots that are older than say, 30 days, use the -olderThan parameter, like:

```powershell
./snapshotList.ps1 -vip mycluster `
                    -username myusername `
                    -domain mydomain.net `
                    -sorted `
                    -olderThan 30
```

## Parameters

* -vip: Cohesity cluster to connect to
* -username: Cohesity username (e.g. admin)
* -domain: (optional) Active Directory domain (defaults to 'local')
* -olderThan: (optional) defaults to 0 days old
* -sorted: (optional) sort by date (default is to sort by job name)
