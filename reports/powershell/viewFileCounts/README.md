This powershell script monitors archive tasks. This is especially useful if have just started archiving and may have a back log that you may wish to monitor, or if you are archiving to a seed and ship device (e.g. AWS Snowball).

## Download the script

Run these commands from PowerShell to download the script(s) into your current directory

```powershell
