                                  -u myusername \
                                  -d mydomain.net
```

To get the backup paths for multiple clusters:

```bash
./directiveBackupHistoryReport.py -v mycluster1 \
                                  -v mycluster2 \
                                  -u myusername \
                                  -d mydomain.net
```
