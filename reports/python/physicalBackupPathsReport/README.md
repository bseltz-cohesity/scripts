# download commands
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/reports/python/physicalBackupPathsReport/physicalBackupPathsReport.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bseltz-cohesity/scripts/master/python/pyhesity.py
chmod +x physicalBackupPathsReport.py
# end download commands
```

## Components

* physicalBackupPathsReport.py: the main powershell script
* pyhesity.py: the Cohesity REST API helper module

Place both files in a folder together and run the main script like so:

To get the backup paths for one cluster:

```bash
./physicalBackupPathsReport.py -v mycluster \
                               -u myusername \
                               -d mydomain.net
```

To get the backup paths for multiple clusters:

```bash
./physicalBackupPathsReport.py -v mycluster1 \
                               -v mycluster2 \
                               -u myusername \
                               -d mydomain.net
```

To get the backup paths for all helios clusters:

```bash
./physicalBackupPathsReport.py -u myusername@mydomain.net
```

To get the backup paths for selected helios clusters:

```bash
./physicalBackupPathsReport.py -u myusername@mydomain.net \
                               -c mycluster1 \
                               -c mycluster2
```
